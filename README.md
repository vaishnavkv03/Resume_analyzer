ATS-Score: The Resume Analyzer
A powerful, open-source web application designed to help job seekers optimize their resumes for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). Upload your resume and receive an instant compatibility score, a list of potential problems, and actionable recommendations to make your resume more ATS-friendly.

‚ú® Features
ATS Compatibility Score: Get a percentage-based score that indicates how well your resume is structured for an Applicant Tracking System.
Problem Identification: The analyzer highlights major issues in your resume, such as poor formatting, missing keywords, or improper section headers.
Actionable Recommendations: For each identified problem, the application provides clear and specific recommendations to improve your resume.
Simple & Intuitive Interface: A clean, easy-to-use interface for a seamless user experience.
Cross-Platform: The web-based application runs locally on any system with Python installed.

üíª Technologies Used
This project is a full-stack application built with a combination of web and backend technologies:
HTML (62%): The core structure of the web pages.
Python (20%): Powers the backend logic, including resume parsing and analysis.
JavaScript (10%): Manages client-side interactions and dynamic content updates.
CSS (7%): Provides the styling and layout for the user interface.

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these steps to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.
Prerequisites
You will need Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system.
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ats-score.git
cd ats-score
Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

# On Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Install the necessary Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: The requirements.txt file should contain the list of packages your backend needs, such as Flask for the web server and a resume parsing library like spacy or pyresparser.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
After completing the installation, you can run the application with a single command.
Start the local server:
python app.py
Note: If your main Python file is named differently, replace app.py with the correct filename.

Access the application:
Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 (or the address shown in your terminal).

üí° How It Works
The application follows a simple architecture:
Frontend (HTML, CSS, JS): The user interacts with a form on the main page. A resume file is uploaded, and the client-side JavaScript sends this file to the Python backend.
Backend (Python): The Python server receives the uploaded resume. It parses the document to extract text and data. This data is then analyzed against a set of criteria to determine the ATS compatibility score, identify problems, and generate recommendations.
Result Display: The Python backend sends the analysis results back to the frontend, which dynamically updates the page to display the score, problems, and recommendations to the user.
